# Heroes Arena

<p> Heroes Arena is a web-based minigame where players can choose a hero and battle against a computer-controlled opponent. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage the game logic and mechanics. </p>

<p> In Heroes Arena, players choose one of three available heroes: Smoliv, Sylveon, or Dragonair. Each hero has its own set of skills, which can be used during the battle to gain advantages over the opponent. The computer-controlled opponent will randomly choose one of the remaining heroes, so players must choose their hero carefully. </p>

<p> The hero skills include the ability to dodge attacks, defend against damage, deal extra damage, or heal themselves. Some skills are RNG-based, so players will need to use strategy and luck to win battles. </p>

<p> During the battle, players can watch the action in the background and receive updates in the battlelog. The game is designed to be simple and easy to understand, but still provides a fun and engaging experience for all players. </p>

## OOP Details
This project was developed as a study project for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. The code makes use of classes, inheritance, and other key features of OOP in JavaScript to manage the game mechanics and logic. This includes:

<ul>
  <li> Creating hero classes and defining their properties and methods. </li>
  <li> Using inheritance to create specialized hero classes. </li>
  <li> Creating a battle class to manage the battle mechanics. </li>
  <li> Implementing methods to manage skill usage and RNG-based outcomes. </li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li> HTML </li>
  <li> CSS </li>
  <li> JavaScript </li>
</ul>

## Gameplay
<ul>
<li> Choose a hero to battle with from a selection of available heroes (Smoliv, Sylveon, or Dragonair). </li>

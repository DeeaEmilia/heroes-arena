# heroes-minigame
A simple minigame written in SASS, JS and HTML. You can choose one character and will fight at random with one of the remaining heroes. 

I have written comments inside the HTML, SCSS and JS files for a friend and decided to leave them in case anyone wants to follow my logic when creating and optimizing this project.

There are still some adjustments to be made to the style and potentially to the scripts too. 

Hope you enjoy it :D.

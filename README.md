# Heroes Arena

<p> Heroes Arena is a web-based minigame where players can choose a hero and battle against a computer-controlled opponent. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage the game logic and mechanics. </p>

## About the game

<p> In Heroes Arena, players choose one of three available heroes: Smoliv, Sylveon, or Dragonair. Each hero has its own set of skills, which will automatically be used during the battle against the opponent. The computer-controlled opponent will randomly choose one of the remaining heroes, so players must choose their hero carefully. </p>

## OOP Details
This project was developed as a study project for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. The code makes use of classes, inheritance, and other key features of OOP in JavaScript to manage the game mechanics and logic. This includes:

<ul>
  <li> Creating hero classes and defining their properties and methods. </li>
  <li> Using inheritance to create specialized hero classes. </li>
  <li> Creating a battle class to manage the battle mechanics. </li>
  <li> Implementing methods to manage skill usage and RNG-based outcomes. </li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li> HTML </li>
  <li> CSS </li>
  <li> JavaScript </li>
</ul>

## Gameplay
<ul>
<li> Choose a hero to battle with from a selection of available heroes (Smoliv, Sylveon, or Dragonair). </li>
<li> The computer-controlled opponent will randomly choose one of the remaining heroes. </li>
<li> Players must use their hero's skills to defeat the opponent and win the battle. </li>
<li> Skills include dodge, defend, extra damage, and heal. </li>
<li> Some skills are RNG-based, so players will need to to be careful at the skill description and also rely on luck to win. </li>
<li> The battle happens in the background, and players can receive updates in the battlelog. </li>
</ul>
